            <p>Mainly just this website. This is self-hosted so the site might be a little slow. this is not due to my sites performance but the limitations of home Internet vs professional Internet. I am a newcomer but despite that I can do pretty much anything you want while getting it done on time.</p>

            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p> I have been interested in programming for as long as I can remember. I did write a small program back in the day that changed the start menu and would change the wallpaper of the log off screen to what ever you wanted. This was oh 8 years ago but I did skip school (was in high school) to work on it so I can be very dedicated to finding how to do something. I never released as I didn't know how or if it would even work with anyone elses system. Since then I either tried going in to other parts of the technology industry or got so caught up with life that I never had the time to come back to it. UNTILL NOW! Thanks to Covid-19 I lost my job and can't seem to find any other job that can sustain my family. </p>
